		<h3> Awakening in New York</h3>

		<p>Curtains forcing their will 
			against the wind, <br>
			children sleep,<br>
			exchanging dreams with <br>
			seraphim. The city<br>
			drags itself awake on <br>
			subway straps; and<br>
			I, an alarm, awake as a <br>
			rumor of war,<br>
			lie stretching into dawn, <br>
			unasked and unheeded.<br>

		<h3> If</h3>

		<p>
			If you can keep your head when all about you<br>
			Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;<br>
			If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br>
			But make allowance for their doubting too:<br>
			If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br>
			Or, being lied about, don't deal in lies,<br>
			Or being hated don't give way to hating,<br>
			And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise;<br><br>

			If you can dream - and not make dreams your master;<br>
			If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim,<br>
			If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br>
			And treat those two impostors just the same:.<br>
			If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken<br>
			Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br>
			Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br>
			And stoop and build'em up with worn-out tools;<br><br>

			If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br>
			And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br>
			And lose, and start again at your beginnings,<br>
			And never breathe a word about your loss:<br>
			If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br>
			To serve your turn long after they are gone,<br>
			And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br>
			Except the Will which says to them: "Hold on!"<br><br>

			If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br>
			Or walk with Kings - nor lose the common touch,<br>
			If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,<br>
			If all men count with you, but none too much:<br>
			If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br>
			With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,<br>
			Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,<br>
			And - which is more - you'll be a Man, my son!<br><br>
